<h1>
Weather app
</h1>

This weather app is written with TypeScript and React.
Design was made with pure CSS few animations with framer motion.

This website allows the user to search the weather of which city he want and
the 5 days forecast.

The default location is the current location of the user.

Favorite city were saved with redux.

Error is shown with modal.

I used AccuWeather API to get the weather data.

The user can toggle the degree type between celsius and fahrenheit

The user can toggle the theme between Light theme and Dark theme
